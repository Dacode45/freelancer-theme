I've decided to take a senior design class my junior year. I will be designing
and building a PCB that drives a VGA display from a USB. The PCB will use a
Spartan 6 and FTDI Mini module. I'm planning on turning this relatively simple
project into a blog about design considerations and what Computer Scientist
should know about building something physical. Later in the semester, I will be
extending the board to display video similar to old NES games possibly allowing
it to drive video from an emulator. Contact me if you have suggestions!
